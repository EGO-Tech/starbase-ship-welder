# Welder - Modular Ship for Starbase

This site houses the blueprints and manual for modular ship Welder for the game Starbase by Frozenbyte.

## Goal

The goal of the Welder ship is to be a modular ship which can be snapped together using modules in the Starbase Ship Designer and welded together with minial additional changes.
It is a ship framework that has a restricted shape so the modules are easy to use and include on the ship.

The blueprints for the ship and its modules are prvoided for free.
