# Welder - Modular Ship for Starbase

This site houses the blueprints and manual for modular ship Welder for the game Starbase by Frozenbyte.

## Goal

The goal of the Welder ship framework is to have a base ship which has connection points to snap additional modules and welded together with minimal additional changes to make a working ship, all in the Starbase Ship Designer.
The framework has a restricted shape so the modules are easy to use and include to make the final ship.

The provided modules are meant to be a guide and provide basic examples of how modules work. It is the hope that the community will build more modules to share.

## Download

The blueprints for the ship and its modules are provided for free. Download the modules [here](https://github.com/vinteo/starbase-ship-welder/raw/main/blueprints/framework/welder.zip) or take a look at some prebuilt ships [here](/ships).

## Features

The base ship has the following features:

- Standard Cruise function
- Turtle and Sloth functions with adjustable rates
- Transponder system with ping function
- Two external and two internal resource bridges
- Auto generator rate script with adjustable minimum rate
- 30 T3 generators with 30 T2 enhancers from 10 T3 fuel chambers and 20 spare rods on racks
- Radiators and heat sinks that provide more than adequate cooling
- 12 large propellant tanks with 144,000,000 units of propellant
- Propellant time and fuel time panels
- 140 batteries
- Two plasma thrusters with five rings each, 32 T3 box and 32 T3 triangle thrusters providing forward thrust
- 32 T3 triangle thrusters providing braking thrust
- 48 T3 triangle thrusters for maneuvers
- [NavGrid by StandPeter](https://github.com/pcbennion/starbase-navgrid)
- [NavCas by fixerid](https://github.com/fixerid/sb-projects/tree/main/NavCas), using custom avoidance system and ISAN 3 in 1 from [Compass by Firestar99](https://gitlab.com/Firestar99/yolol/-/blob/master/src/compass/README.md), with ability to load target from NavGrid
- Warning lights and alarm for obstacle detection and avoidance

## Providing Feedback

I can be found in-game as Egomaniac and on discord as vinteo#4211.

Feel free to contact me and provide feedback or if you need help, use the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/vinteo/starbase-ship-welder/issues). Pull requests are also welcomed for scripts changes/fixes.

I would also love for the communiity to create modules so if you do please share them!

Of course in-game tips are greatly appreciated.
