# Constructing the Ship

The ship consist of three main sections - the back, the [body](./constructing/body-section) and the front.

The back and front sections contain the essential devices and machinery that allow the ship to function so the base back and front sections are required.
They can be extended using modules.

The body section is constructed using various modules.

:::note

The body section is optional and the ship can function without it.

:::

Some of the more advanced modules may require additional steps to connect. It will be explained in the documentation for those modules.

Once all the sections are connected together with the additional modules you wish, the final step is to weld all the beams together.

:::tip

It is recommended to construct the ship from back to front.
