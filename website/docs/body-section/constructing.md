# Constructing the Body

The body section is put together by welding together a series of modules of different sizes.

## Module Sizes

The size of the modules are measured using units of 144cm (known as U).
Strictly speaking though these are not always exactly 144cm as there are some additinal space used for 24cm beams depending on the module.

The width (sideways in relation to the ship) of the body modules come in four different sizes - 2U, 3U, 4U and 8U.

The length (lengthwise in relation to the ship) also come in four sizes - S (2U), M (4U), L (6U) and XL (8U).

## Body Layout

The total width of the body can be 4U, 6U and 8U. It is recommended to maintain the same width for the entire body.
There are restrictions in place to maintain the ease of use of the modules.

4U bodies can only be put together using 4U modules.

6U bodies can only be put together using two 3U modules.

8U bodies can be put together either using one 8U module, using two 4U modules or using two 3U modules with a 2U module in between.

The body then can be covered using hull modules that go on the side as well as top and bottom to complete the body.

## Connecting to the Back and Front Sections

The back and front section have connections for up to 8U in wdith.
If your body is less that 8U, there are adapter hull modules that can be used to bridge the gap.
