# Introduction

The goal of the Welder ship is to be a modular ship which can be snapped together using modules in the Starbase Ship Designer and welded together with minial additional changes.
It is a ship framework that has a restricted shape so the modules are easy to use and include on the ship.

The Welder framework consist of three major sections - the front, the back and the body.

The front and back sections have a fixed module that houses essential machinery and devices for the basic functions of the the ship.
Smaller modules can be attached to various points of these fixed modules.

The body section is put together by welding together a series of modules. These modules will extend the functionality of the ship.
The with of the body can vary depending on the modules used.
